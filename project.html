                <article class="post">
                    <p class="dateLabel">2014/09/01</p>
                    <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
					<h4>[background on DNA origami and its application to create nanopore]</h4>
                    <p> 
						For a long time, building nanostructures have been dominated by the use of inorganic materials such as polymers and metals. 
						However, the advent of DNA origami has launched a myriad of opportunities to build nanostructures using biomolecules, with the inherent advantage of being easier to engineer for direct biological relevance. 
						DNA origami exploits the nature of Watson-Crick base pairing to create extremely small structures out of DNA with sub-nanometer precision. 
						The energetically more stable form of the “folded” form prompts the DNA to self-assemble without needing any additional process. 
						The basic structure of a DNA origami consists of one strand of ssDNA called the “scaffold”, which then pairs with the designed shorter strands called the “staple” strands to realize the intended folding.
					</p>
					<h4>[why are they creating nanopores]</h4>
					<p>Nanopores, as the name suggests, are incredibly tiny channels or openings on the nanoscale, typically measuring just a few nanometers in diameter. They play a pivotal role in various scientific applications, particularly in the fields of biotechnology and materials science. Nanopores can be found in natural systems, such as cell membranes, where they facilitate the transport of ions and molecules. 
					</p>
					<p>In other words, DNA membrane channels are being engineered to mimic a natural system of chemical exchange: where molecules pass between two distinct environments. In nature, chemical exchange systems govern various phenomena that keep all organisms alive and even keep the planet together.
					</p><br clear="all" />

					<h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
					<p>Despite that, most DNA channels struggle to really mimic the functionality of naturally occurring ones. For example, the reversibility of the opening and closing of a natural membrane channel plays a crucial role in how it establishes its importance. 
						Many opening-closing mechanisms devised in DNA origami require the removal of an existing component of the system, as is usually done through strand displacement reactions or enzymatic digestion of DNA strands. 
						As such, restoration to the initial state without ‘refueling’ is usually difficult, unrealistic, or just plainly impossible.
					</p>
					<p>In addition, the operation of DNA nanopores is currently tied to liquid environments. 
						Of the many chemical processes in nature, many of them require the interaction between solution and gas, or even occur solely in the gaseous phase. 
						Therefore, to truly mimic functionality of these systems, there needs to be a novelty in enabling DNA origami nanostructures to interface environments that are in different states of matter. 
						As such, the liquid-centric nature of current DNA nanopores leaves the full potential of DNA nanostructures' functionality practically unexplored.
					</p>
					<p>To summarize, inability to interact with dry environments, coupled with the inability to reversibly open and close without additional input of DNA or protein (which would also be impossible in dry environments) presents a unique and crucial challenge for the whole field of biomolecular nanotechnology. 
						This liquid-centric trait prevents more complex molecular robots in reaching its full potential not only in technical functionality but also in real-world applications. 
						For example, the inability to function in environments surrounded by air severely limits its applicability in dry environments, where humans live and many causes of our current problems lie, such as climate change and airborne pathogens. 
					</p>	
					<p>With the elaboration above, we came up with several questions:</p>
					<p>What if we can create a tunnel-like structure with DNA that allows gaseous molecules to pass through? However, in order to do that, then we must also wonder what if we devised a way for a DNA nanostructure to connect two ‘dry’ environments while still facilitating the ionic conductivity required for successful assembly of it? 
						Would that set a foot towards application of DNA origami devices to be able to transmit gaseous molecules between different compartments of nanorobots, thus allowing gaseous sensing? 
						Would it be able to propel research and technology in fields requiring very precise chemical control, such as materials engineering and finemechanics? 
					</p>
					<p>Furthermore, in this unique environment, what if we devised a novel mechanism for reversible opening-closing of the DNA channel? 
						Would it be possible then in the future to use such technology to create complex systems that rely on gas exchange to create devices that control greenhouse gas emissions? 
						Maybe fully photosynthesizing artificial leaves? Or even fine-tune weather control? All through the use of DNA-based nanostructures. (See more in-depth elaboration on our <a href="future.html">Future page!</a>)

					<h3>THE CHALLENGES</h3>
					<h4>[hydrophobicity of gas phase]</h4>
					<p>
						In considering our question, we come across the first challenge: the hydrophobic environment required to facilitate the movement of gas.
						This challenge is outlined by the inherent hydrophilicity of DNA, which would also mean that design of DNA origami and ideal working conditions would be those where it can be stabilized by water molecules. 			
					</p>
					<h4>[membrane that connects two air chambers]</h4>
					<p>In order to transport gas between two distinct places, those two places would naturally be filled with gas and the transporter structure would need to be placed in between these gas chambers. 
						However, current DNA nanostructures that transport molecules are usually embedded in a lipid bilayer membrane, which would mean that they connect between two hydrophilic environments: a no-go for gas exchange.
					</p>
					<h4>[size of gas molecules]</h4>
					<p>The size of the transported molecules is also our next concern. 
						Due to the nature of atoms and intermolecular forces, molecules that are in the gaseous phase under normal atmospheric conditions tend to be extremely small, and tremendously smaller when compared to the biomolecules that many DNA nanostructures are designed to facilitate.
					</p>
					<h4>[limited experimental methods to assess gas molecules (e.g. No gaseous fluorescent probe)]</h4>
					<p>Due to there is virtually no research done in this field, there is a very limited amount of established research methods that validly test mechanisms of gas transport using biomolecular nanotechnology.
					</p>
					<br clear="all" />

					<h3>OUR SOLUTION</h3>
					<h4>[overview]</h4>
					<p>We devised a DNA origami valve, called the NanoStoma, designed to self-integrate into a soap bubble’s membrane and facilitate light-inducible gas exchange. 
					</p>
					<p>Our DNA Origami structure was designed to mimic the structure of stomata found on plant leaves, which open and close to control gas exchange for photosynthesis. More specifically, we were inspired by the stomatal opening system of CAM plants, which entails stomatal opening during nighttime and closing during daytime, controlled by blue light exposure. 
						The NanoStoma self-stacks and integrates itself to the membrane of a bubble, connecting the air space inside and outside of the bubble. In its initial state, blocker DNA strands block the resulting tunnel, preventing gas molecules from traveling between the chambers. When exposed to UV light, the photoresponsive groups within the DNA dissociate the blocker DNA duplex, opening the tunnel and allowing the passage of molecules. 
						The mechanism by which the NanoStoma operates is detailed in the Design section.
